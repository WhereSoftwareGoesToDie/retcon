-- | Description: Abstract storage for retcon operational data.
--
-- Retcon maintains quite a lot of operational data. This module defines an
-- interface which can be implemented against various data storage backends.
--
-- The library includes type implementations of this interface in the
-- 'Retcon.Store.PostgreSQL' and 'Retcon.Store.Memory' modules.
module Retcon.Store where

import Retcon.DataSource
import Retcon.Diff
import Retcon.Document
import Retcon.Options

-- | A storage backend for retcon operational data
--
-- In production this will interact with a PostgreSQL database, but testing and
-- demonstrations will likely use an in-memory or other low-dependency
-- alternative.
--
-- All operations must be implemented.
