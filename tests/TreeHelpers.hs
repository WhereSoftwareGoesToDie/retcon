-- | Generate a random tree with roughtly the given number of nodes.

-- This is thorougly biased, but will definitely terminate. Essentially
-- we generate trees according to the size in the following cases:
--
-- - size 1 - make a single leaf node.
-- - size <= 5 - make a node with leafish children.
-- - size > 5 - split it into roughly branchingFactor branches.
--
-- This will only generate JSON-ish trees.
